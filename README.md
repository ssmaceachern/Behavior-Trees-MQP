Master - Holds the final version of the project at the end of a term.

Dev - Holds the prototyped version of the game for playtesting and drawing feedback.

Feature - Branch to form new branches from.
Naming convention: feature-[Initials]-[Name of feature]


Procedure:
Make a new branch using the Feature branch as the base. Name the branch using the Feature branch naming conventions and make changes.
After a number of features have been created, the features will be merged into a fork of the dev branch to be tested and debugged in the form of pull requests.
Once all known bugs are removed from the forked dev branch, it will be merged into the original dev branch and will in term get merged into the Feature branch so new features can be made with the up-to-date version of the project.
